# Assighment-
1. Create any interface with two methods (one of them must have a default implementation)
Inside the main method, you are asked to create a reference of that interface type, without having any concrete class that implements an interface.

2. Create any concrete class that has 2 private fields (without getters and setters) and several methods. Try to create an object of that class using reflection (without operator new), set any value to that fields and print it to console
